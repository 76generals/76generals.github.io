Webcrypt is a client-side web browser-based file encryption that will encrypt and decrypt the contents of a file using RSA algorithm. 

The web page is rendered in the user’s browser to encrypt a file using a password provide by the user, the same password will be used to decrypt the file. 

It uses JavaScript running within a web browser to encrypt and decrypt files. 

It does not necessarily need network connections during the process, to ensure that the user’s files and password do not leave their web browser during the process.

The webcrypt is self-contained and does not require any supporting files; all JavaScript and CSS for the page are contained in the source code of the page.
